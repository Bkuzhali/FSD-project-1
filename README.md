# My Ecommerce Store

A simple e-commerce website built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project demonstrates dynamic product listing, filtering, and shopping cart functionality using **Local Storage** without a backend.


## **Project Files**

* `index.html` – Homepage with hero section and categories.
* `products.html` – Displays all products with filtering options.
* `product_detail.html` – Shows detailed information of a selected product.
* `cart.html` – Shopping cart page listing selected products with removal option.
* `style.css` – Stylesheet for layout, design, and responsive behavior.
* `script.js` – Handles dynamic functionality:

  * Displaying products and filtering by category/price
  * Adding/removing products to/from cart
  * Storing cart data in **Local Storage**
* `images/` – Folder containing product and category images.


## **Key Functionalities**

1. **Dynamic Product Display** – Products are rendered dynamically using JavaScript.
2. **Filtering** – Filter products by category and maximum price.
3. **Shopping Cart** – Add/remove products; cart persists across page reloads.
4. **Responsive Layout** – Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

* **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* **Storage:** Local Storage for cart management
* **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Web Browser

If you want, I can also make a **super minimal version** that fits neatly in GitHub without screenshots or extra text. Do you want me to do that?
